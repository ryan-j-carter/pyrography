            <p class="about-text p-inline">Cody's first commercial success came with the 1999 film American Pie, as Steve Stifler, a role he reprised in three sequels, 
            American Pie 2 (2001), American Wedding (2003), and American Reunion (2012).[1] For his supporting role in the first film, Cody was 
            paid only $8,000.[2] Cody was granted the lead role in American Wedding, though he only received second billing, and the character propelled 
            him into the public consciousness.</p>

            <p class="about-text">Cody's fear of typecasting led him to play different types of characters post-American Pie, such as a hapless nerd 
            in the horror film Final Destination and a friendly stoner in Dude, Where's My Car?.</p>
